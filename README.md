# HNMobileTest

Code setup
git clone https://github.com/asefnoor/HNMobileTest.git

How to run it?
Open workspace in XCode and you can choose to run on iPhone device or iPhone simulator. This app is tested on iPhone 5s, iOS 8.1.


Area to improve:
Instead of archiving and unarchiving coredata could have used.
Right now, every time user fetches latest items from server, all items are rewritten to memory. Instead only delta could have updated.
